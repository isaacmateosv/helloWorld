# helloWorld
Learning new tools. 

So this is where I'm meant to write something about myself. So let's do it simple and fast. I'm an Electronics Engineering Student. I'm also a musician (I play guitar, bass and double-bass). I'm Christian, meaning I live my everything for Jesus. Also, I love programming, but I guess I'm not good at all yet.
I'm also a son, brother and friend. I'd love to accomplish whatever the purpose God has given to me, I'm not quite sure what it'll be, but I'll be ready, ve!
